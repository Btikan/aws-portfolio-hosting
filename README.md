# AWS Portfolio Hosting

This is my personal **static portfolio website**, hosted on **GitHub Pages** as part of my **Cloud + Cybersecurity journey**.  
It showcases my ability to design, host, and manage static sites, and will later be upgraded to an **AWS-based hosting architecture** (S3, CloudFront, Route53, ACM, IAM).
